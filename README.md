# Hotel-Analytics-Python-Project
* Introduction

Welcome to the AtliQ Hotels Data Analytics Project! This project aims to analyze the booking data of AtliQ Hotels, a fictitious chain of hotels, to generate valuable insights that can help in strategic decision-making. The analysis is performed on a comprehensive bookings database, which includes various dimensions and fact tables.

* Project Structure

The project follows a structured approach to ensure thorough analysis and insight generation. The steps involved are:

Understanding Business Problems

Data Collection and Understanding

Data Cleaning and Exploration

Data Transformation

Insight Generation

* Database Schema

The database consists of the following tables:

dim_date: Contains date-related information.

dim_hotels: Contains information about the hotels.

dim_rooms: Contains information about the rooms.

fact_aggregated_bookings: Contains aggregated booking data.

fact_booking: Contains detailed booking data.

* Steps Involved
  
1. Understanding Business Problems:
   
The first step involves understanding the key business problems that AtliQ Hotels is facing. This includes identifying areas where data-driven insights can provide value, such as improving occupancy rates, optimizing pricing strategies, and enhancing customer satisfaction.

2. Data Collection and Understanding
   
In this step, we collect data from the various tables in the database. We explore the structure and content of each table to understand the relationships between them and the type of information they hold.

3. Data Cleaning and Exploration
   
Data cleaning is crucial to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis. This step involves handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and removing duplicates. We also perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover initial patterns and trends in the data.

4. Data Transformation
   
Data transformation involves preparing the data for analysis by creating new features, normalizing data, and aggregating information as needed. This step ensures that the data is in a suitable format for generating insights.

5. Insight Generation
 
In the AtliQ Hotels Data Analytics Project, several key insights were generated using Python and the pandas library. These insights provide valuable information for strategic decision-making and operational improvements. Here are the specific insights derived from the data:

Average Occupancy Rate for Each Room Category:

Calculated the average occupancy rate for different room categories to understand which types of rooms are most frequently booked. This helps in optimizing room allocation and pricing strategies.

Average Occupancy Rate per City:

Printed the average occupancy rate for each city where AtliQ Hotels operates. This insight helps in identifying cities with higher demand and potential for expansion or targeted marketing efforts.

Weekday vs. Weekend Occupancy:

Determined whether the occupancy rates were higher on weekdays or weekends. This analysis helps in understanding booking patterns and adjusting pricing or promotional strategies accordingly.

Occupancy for Different Cities in June:

Calculated the occupancy rates for different cities specifically for the month of June. This seasonal analysis helps in planning for peak periods and managing resources effectively.

Appending New Data:

Appended new booking data for the month of August to the existing dataset. This ensures that the analysis remains up-to-date and incorporates the latest trends and patterns.

Revenue Realized per City:

Printed the total revenue realized from bookings in each city. This insight helps in identifying the most profitable locations and making informed decisions about resource allocation and investment.

Month-by-Month Revenue:

Printed the revenue realized on a month-by-month basis. This temporal analysis helps in understanding revenue trends over time and planning for future financial performance.

Revenue Realized per Hotel Type:

Analyzed the revenue generated by different types of hotels (e.g., resort, city hotel). This helps in understanding which hotel types are more profitable and tailoring business strategies accordingly.

Revenue Realized per Booking Platform:

Printed the revenue realized from different booking platforms. This insight helps in identifying the most effective channels for bookings and optimizing marketing efforts.

* Learning Obtained
  
Throughout the AtliQ Hotels Data Analytics Project, several key learnings were acquired, particularly in the realm of data analysis using Python and the pandas library:

Data Handling with pandas: Gained proficiency in manipulating large datasets using pandas, including merging, filtering, and aggregating data efficiently.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Learned to perform comprehensive EDA to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and anomalies within the data.

Data Cleaning Techniques: Developed skills in cleaning data by handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring data quality.

Visualization: Became adept at visualizing data using pandas.

Problem-Solving Approach: Enhanced the ability to approach business problems systematically and translate them into data-driven solutions.

* Impact

The impact of the AtliQ Hotels Data Analytics Project on the fictitious hotel chain was substantial:

Enhanced Decision-Making: The insights generated from the analysis enabled the management team to make informed decisions regarding pricing strategies, marketing campaigns, and operational improvements.

Increased Occupancy Rates: By identifying peak booking periods and factors influencing cancellations, the hotel chain could implement targeted strategies to increase occupancy rates.

Optimized Resource Allocation: The analysis helped in optimizing resource allocation, ensuring that staff and amenities were efficiently used during high-demand periods.

Improved Customer Satisfaction: Understanding customer booking behavior allowed AtliQ Hotels to tailor their offerings and services, leading to enhanced customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Cost Savings: Through better forecasting and planning, the hotel chain could reduce unnecessary costs and improve overall profitability.
